# README

This directory must exist in order for pileup text files to be written out.  Could I have just made it that they get written out in the working directory?  Sure, but I did it this way to avoid clutter.  This file assures that the puTextFiles directory exists when the repo is cloned (git does not store empty directories for whatever reason).  Have a nice day!
